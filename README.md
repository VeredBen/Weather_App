Project Title: 

Project Purpose: Create a useful utility to check the weather conditions to alert people in my apartment house that conditions are windy enough to damage the screen doors and storm doors.  It serves as an early warning system to prevent house damage. It is also a training project to learn more Python, how to Streamlit full stack web applications, how to use REST APIs to retrieve data from remote services.

Application Details: 

The utility presents a 5-days forecast for Wind, Temperature and Precipitation in many major cities in the USA.

1. Select a state and a city
2. Select units (Metric or Imperial)
3. Press "Show Weather"

Lessons Learned: 

Using Cloud services takes a lot of setup work, (and often a credit card) to make things work.  

Future Enhancements: 
- Determine if there's a way to send wind alerts for free via SMS or Email (no credit card needed)
-
